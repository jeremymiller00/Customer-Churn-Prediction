## Case Study

This classification case study required us to use many of the skills we have learned to tackle a real
problem in industry. The problem is churn prediction with a ride-sharing
company in San Francisco. We worked in small teams to understand the data, develop and tune a strong classification model, and provide actionable business recommendation to prevent customer churn. Most of the necessary code is present. I am still in the process of organizing the code and building out the appropriate notebook for presentation. The file 'final_run.py' contains the summary and results.
